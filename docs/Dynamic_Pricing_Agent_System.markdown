# Dynamic Pricing Agent System Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the implementation of a Dynamic Pricing Agent System using open-source tools and frameworks. The system leverages a multi-agent architecture with a Supervisor Agent coordinating sub-agents (Web Scraping Agent, Competitor Monitoring Agent, Pricing Decision Agent, Demand Analysis Agent, and Inventory Tracking Agent) to dynamically adjust prices based on competitor data, demand, and inventory levels.

## Technology Stack
- **Language Model**: Open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA or Mistral) hosted locally or via Groq API for inference.
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone (free tier) for storing and retrieving vectorized data.
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers for generating embeddings.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for context storage.
- **Message Broker**: Redis Pub/Sub for inter-agent communication.
- **Framework**: LangChain for agent orchestration and memory management, CrewAI for multi-agent coordination.
- **Monitoring**: Custom dashboard using open-source tools (e.g., Grafana).

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Supervisor Agent**
   - Orchestrates the pricing cycle and coordinates sub-agents.
   - Implemented using CrewAI with a custom controller to manage agent workflows.
   - Uses LangChain's memory module to retain context across cycles.

2. **Web Scraping Agent**
   - Scrapes competitor product data (prices, descriptions, availability) from e-commerce platforms.
   - Utilizes Scrapy or BeautifulSoup with custom scripts, integrated with LangChain tools.
   - Publishes scraped data to Redis Pub/Sub.

3. **Competitor Monitoring Agent**
   - Monitors competitor data stored in PostgreSQL.
   - Uses Sentence Transformers to embed and compare product data, stored in Pinecone.
   - Subscribes to Web Scraping Agent updates via Redis.

4. **Pricing Decision Agent**
   - Analyzes competitor data and demand scores to set optimal prices.
   - Implements a rule-based or LLM-driven pricing logic, retrained with feedback using LangChain's memory.
   - Stores decisions in PostgreSQL and logs to the Monitoring Dashboard.

5. **Demand Analysis Agent**
   - Analyzes demand trends based on sales data from the e-commerce platform.
   - Uses statistical models or LLM analysis, with embeddings stored in Pinecone.
   - Publishes demand scores to PostgreSQL.

6. **Inventory Tracking Agent**
   - Fetches and monitors inventory levels from the e-commerce platform.
   - Updates PostgreSQL with inventory data and publishes updates via Redis.
   - Subscribes to sales data for real-time tracking.

### Data Flow
- **Competitor Websites** → Web Scraping Agent → Redis Pub/Sub → Competitor Monitoring Agent → PostgreSQL.
- **E-commerce Platform** → Inventory Tracking Agent → PostgreSQL → Pricing Decision Agent.
- **E-commerce Platform** → Demand Analysis Agent → PostgreSQL → Pricing Decision Agent.
- **Pricing Decision Agent** → PostgreSQL → Monitoring Dashboard.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setup Environment
- Install dependencies: Python, Redis, PostgreSQL, Pinecone SDK, Sentence Transformers, LangChain, CrewAI.
- Configure local LLM (e.g., LLaMA) or use Groq API for inference.
- Initialize PostgreSQL database with tables for competitor data, pricing decisions, demand scores, and inventory levels.

### 2. Agent Development
- **Supervisor Agent**: Create a CrewAI agent with a workflow to trigger sub-agents in sequence. Use LangChain memory to store cycle context.
  ```python
  from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
  from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

  memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
  supervisor = Agent(role="Supervisor", goal="Orchestrate pricing cycle", memory=memory)
  ```

- **Web Scraping Agent**: Develop a Scrapy spider to extract data, publish to Redis.
  ```python
  import scrapy
  from redis import Redis

  class ProductSpider(scrapy.Spider):
      def parse(self, response):
          data = {"price": response.css(".price::text").get(), "availability": response.css(".stock::text").get()}
          redis = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)
          redis.publish("scraped_data", str(data))
  ```

- **Competitor Monitoring Agent**: Use Sentence Transformers to embed data, store in Pinecone.
  ```python
  from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
  from pinecone import Pinecone

  model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
  pc = Pinecone(api_key="your_api_key")
  index = pc.Index("competitor-data")
  embeddings = model.encode(["product description"])
  index.upsert(vectors=[("id1", embeddings)])
  ```

- **Pricing Decision Agent**: Implement logic using LLM and store results.
  ```python
  from langchain.llms import Grok
  llm = Grok(model_name="mistral")
  price_decision = llm.predict("Set price based on competitor data and demand score")
  ```

- **Demand Analysis Agent**: Analyze sales data and compute demand scores.
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  sales_data = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM sales", conn)
  demand_score = sales_data["sales"].mean()
  ```

- **Inventory Tracking Agent**: Fetch and update inventory.
  ```python
  inventory = fetch_inventory_from_platform()
  conn.execute("INSERT INTO inventory (level) VALUES (%s)", (inventory,))
  ```

### 3. Integration
- Connect agents via Redis Pub/Sub for real-time communication.
- Store all persistent data in PostgreSQL.
- Use LangChain to retrain LLM based on feedback from the Monitoring Dashboard.

### 4. Monitoring Dashboard
- Build a simple dashboard using Grafana with PostgreSQL as a data source.
- Log agent messages and decisions for analysis and retraining.

### 5. Retraining and Feedback Loop
- Use LangChain's memory and vector store to log agent outputs.
- Periodically retrain the LLM with new data from PostgreSQL and Pinecone, adjusting based on dashboard feedback.

## Deployment
- Run Redis and PostgreSQL locally or on a free cloud service (e.g., Heroku for PostgreSQL).
- Deploy agents on a local server or use a free-tier cloud service (e.g., Render).
- Monitor and adjust based on real-time data and feedback.

## Future Improvements
- Add more sophisticated demand prediction using time-series models.
- Integrate additional open-source LLMs for enhanced decision-making.
- Scale Pinecone usage with increased data volume.
