# Project Requirement Document: Dynamic Pricing Agent System

## 1. Project Overview
The Dynamic Pricing Agent System automates product pricing for an e-commerce platform by leveraging real-time data on demand, competitor pricing, inventory levels, and time-based rules. A dedicated Web Scraping Agent retrieves comprehensive product information from competitor websites to enhance pricing decisions. The system uses a multi-agent architecture to maximize revenue, maintain competitiveness, and optimize sales conversions with minimal human intervention.

## 2. Objectives
- Automate price adjustments based on real-time market and inventory data
- Implement a scalable multi-agent system with autonomous decision-making, including a Web Scraping Agent
- Enable agent-to-agent communication for collaborative problem-solving
- Provide a robust, production-ready solution with monitoring and logging
- Support multi-tenant architecture for different business units
- Incorporate learning for continuous improvement

## 3. Functional Requirements
### 3.1 Agent Architecture
- **Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrates sub-agents, manages workflows, and ensures task completion
- **Demand Analysis Agent**: Analyzes sales velocity and trends to calculate demand scores
- **Competitor Monitoring Agent**: Processes competitor data provided by the Web Scraping Agent
- **Inventory Tracking Agent**: Monitors stock levels to inform pricing decisions
- **Pricing Decision Agent**: Calculates optimal prices based on inputs from other agents
- **Web Scraping Agent**: Autonomously retrieves complete product information (e.g., prices, descriptions, availability) from competitor websites

### 3.2 Communication Protocols
- JSON-based message passing with standardized schemas
- Event-driven architecture using Redis pub/sub
- Shared PostgreSQL database for context storage
- Negotiation protocols for task distribution
- Feedback loops for performance improvement

### 3.3 Data Integration
- Universal adapters for PostgreSQL data sources
- Real-time data connectors for demand, inventory, and competitor pricing
- Web Scraping Agent integrates with external websites via libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy
- Support for external APIs and web scraping for competitor data

### 3.4 Advanced Features
- Reinforcement learning for pricing optimization
- Multi-tenant support for isolated business units
- Collaborative filtering across similar products
- Proactive insights for market trends and anomalies
- Agent performance telemetry and decision logging
- Web Scraping Agent handles dynamic websites and rate limiting

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of products and frequent price updates
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance**: Price updates within 60 seconds of data changes; web scraping within configurable intervals
- **Security**: Secure API access, data encryption, and ethical web scraping practices
- **Maintainability**: Modular code with comprehensive documentation

## 5. Technical Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain, CrewAI
- **LLM Models**: OpenAI GPT-4, OpenRouter, Claude, Llama 3
- **Communication**: Redis pub/sub for messaging
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for shared context
- **Web Scraping**: Python with BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium
- **Monitoring**: Custom telemetry for agent performance
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.10+

## 6. Constraints
- Dependency on reliable external data sources and website accessibility for scraping
- Compliance with e-commerce regulations, pricing policies, and web scraping ethics
- Limited initial budget for cloud infrastructure
- Integration with existing e-commerce platforms

## 7. Assumptions
- Real-time data feeds are available for demand and inventory
- Competitor websites allow ethical scraping or provide APIs
- Business units provide clear pricing rules and target websites for scraping

## 8. Deliverables
- Multi-agent system codebase, including Web Scraping Agent
- Database schema and setup scripts
- API documentation for external integrations
- Monitoring dashboard for agent performance
- User guide for system configuration, maintenance, and web scraping setup

## 9. Timeline
- Phase 1 (2 months): Design and core agent development, including Web Scraping Agent
- Phase 2 (2 months): Integration with data sources, web scraping, and testing
- Phase 3 (1 month): Deployment and performance optimization
- Total: 5 months

## 10. Stakeholders
- E-commerce business owner
- Development team
- Data engineering team
- Operations team for monitoring and maintenance
