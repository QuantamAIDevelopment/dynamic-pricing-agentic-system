# Dynamic Pricing Agent System Development Prompt

You are an advanced AI assistant with expertise in building Agentic AI Systems. Your task is to develop a fully functional Dynamic Pricing Agent System based on the provided architecture diagram. The system should include a Supervisor Agent coordinating sub-agents (Web Scraping Agent, Competitor Monitoring Agent, Pricing Decision Agent, Demand Analysis Agent, and Inventory Tracking Agent) to dynamically adjust prices based on competitor data, demand, and inventory levels. Use the following technologies and guidelines:

- **Language Model**: Open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA or Mistral) hosted locally or via Groq API for inference.
- **Vector Store**: Pinecone (free tier) for storing and retrieving vectorized data.
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers for generating embeddings.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for context storage.
- **Message Broker**: Redis Pub/Sub for inter-agent communication.
- **Frameworks**: LangChain for agent orchestration and memory management, CrewAI for multi-agent coordination.
- **Monitoring**: Custom dashboard using open-source tools (e.g., Grafana).

## Requirements
1. **Setup Environment**: Install and configure Python, Redis, PostgreSQL, Pinecone SDK, Sentence Transformers, LangChain, and CrewAI. Initialize a local LLM or use Groq API.
2. **Agent Implementation**:
   - **Supervisor Agent**: Orchestrate the pricing cycle, manage sub-agent workflows using CrewAI, and retain context with LangChain memory.
   - **Web Scraping Agent**: Scrape competitor product data (prices, descriptions, availability) using Scrapy or BeautifulSoup, publish to Redis Pub/Sub.
   - **Competitor Monitoring Agent**: Monitor competitor data in PostgreSQL, use Sentence Transformers to embed data, store in Pinecone.
   - **Pricing Decision Agent**: Analyze competitor data and demand scores to set prices using LLM logic, store decisions in PostgreSQL.
   - **Demand Analysis Agent**: Analyze sales data to compute demand scores, store in PostgreSQL.
   - **Inventory Tracking Agent**: Fetch and monitor inventory levels from an e-commerce platform, update PostgreSQL, publish updates via Redis.
3. **Integration**: Connect agents via Redis Pub/Sub, store persistent data in PostgreSQL, and use LangChain for LLM retraining based on feedback.
4. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Build a simple dashboard with Grafana using PostgreSQL data.
5. **Retraining**: Implement a feedback loop to retrain the LLM using LangChain memory and Pinecone data.
6. **Deployment**: Run on a local server or free-tier cloud service (e.g., Heroku for PostgreSQL, Render for agents).

## Tasks
- Write complete Python code for each agent, including setup, data processing, and communication logic.
- Provide SQL scripts to create and manage PostgreSQL tables.
- Generate configuration files for Redis, Pinecone, and Grafana.
- Include error handling, logging, and documentation for maintainability.
- Ensure the system runs end-to-end, fetching data, processing it, and updating prices dynamically.

## Constraints
- Use only free and open-source tools as specified.
- Avoid local file I/O or network calls outside Redis Pub/Sub.
- Ensure compatibility with a browser-based environment where applicable.
- The system should be operational by 02:50 PM IST on Sunday, July 06, 2025, with a focus on real-time functionality.

## Output
- Provide a full codebase with modular scripts for each component.
- Include a step-by-step deployment guide.
- Validate the system with sample data and log outputs for verification.

Proceed with the development and ensure all components are integrated and functional.
