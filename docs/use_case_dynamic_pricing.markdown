# Use Case: Dynamic Pricing Agent System

## Use Case Title
Automated Dynamic Pricing for E-Commerce Products

## Problem Statement
E-commerce businesses struggle to manually adjust product prices to reflect real-time market conditions, such as fluctuating demand, competitor pricing, and inventory levels. Additionally, gathering comprehensive competitor product information (e.g., prices, descriptions, availability) is labor-intensive and prone to errors. Manual pricing and data collection are time-consuming, reducing competitiveness and revenue potential. An automated system with a dedicated web scraping agent is needed to dynamically adjust prices and retrieve complete product information, minimizing human workload while improving pricing accuracy and sales conversions.

## Description
The Dynamic Pricing Agent System employs a multi-agent architecture to autonomously adjust product prices and gather competitor data. A Supervisor Agent orchestrates five specialized agents:
- **Demand Analysis Agent**: Evaluates sales velocity and trends to compute a demand score.
- **Competiitor Monitoring Agent**: Processes competitor product data provided by the Web Scraping Agent.
- **Inventory Tracking Agent**: Monitors stock levels to inform pricing decisions.
- **Pricing Decision Agent**: Calculates optimal prices using inputs from other agents, applying predefined rules and learning mechanisms.
- **Web Scraping Agent**: Autonomously scrapes competitor websites for complete product information, including prices, descriptions, and availability, using tools like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.

Agents communicate via JSON-based messages over Redis pub/sub, with shared context stored in PostgreSQL. The system uses LangChain and CrewAI for agent orchestration, integrating multiple LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) for decision-making. The Web Scraping Agent handles dynamic websites, respects rate limits, and ensures ethical scraping practices. The system supports multi-tenant isolation, reinforcement learning for pricing optimization, and proactive insights for market trends.

### Workflow
1. The Supervisor Agent initiates a pricing cycle for a product.
2. The Web Scraping Agent retrieves competitor product data (prices, descriptions, availability) and publishes it to the Competitor Monitoring Agent.
3. Sub-agents (Demand, Competitor, Inventory) collect and analyze data, publishing results to the Supervisor.
4. The Supervisor aggregates inputs and triggers the Pricing Decision Agent.
5. The Pricing Decision Agent calculates and applies the optimal price, logging decisions for future learning.
6. The system continuously monitors data changes, generating proactive insights as needed.
